## Problem 2

Choose and critique one of the visualization by one of your fellow classmates for HW 1 Problem 2 (distribution of income across countries and continents over time). Include a link to the original. Describe the visualization and how it is similar and/or different from yours. Is it easy to interpret? Does it effectively visualize what is being asked? Why or why not?

To compare across continents, a static plot has been incorporated which is similar to what i have done. However for the distribtuion of income across countries, a dynamic plot has been used compared to static plot of mine.

The dynamic plot with a world map incorporated is a visual treat to observe and it represents so much information effieciently. The timeline scale shows how the income changes over time. The only disadvantage of the dynamic plot is that if you want to check out the changes for a particular country over time and see if there was any dip or increase, a static might be a better choice.

## Problem 3

Choose and critique one of the visualization by one of your fellow classmates for HW 1 Problem 3 (relationship between income, life expectancy, and child mortality over time). Include a link to the original. Describe the visualization and how it is similar and/or different from yours. Is it easy to interpret? Does it effectively visualize what is being asked? Why or why not?

The static plot to depict relationship between income, life expectancy and child mortality is similar to what i have. The plot is substantiated with explanation of dips and outliers and potential reasons for it which is worth noting. However the solution is devoid of the explicit representation of relationship across all continents.
